Use these IDs with `izwi tts --speaker`, the Text to Speech page, or
the `voice` field on `/v1/audio/speech` (or `speaker` on `/v1/text-to-speech`).

Saved and reference voices use `--saved-voice-id`, `reference_audio`, or the
Voice Studio saved voice library instead of these built-in speaker IDs.

## Maya1

`Maya1-3B` has no recorded voices: each built-in voice is a description in
the style the model was trained on, and the model invents a voice to match
it. A request's own description (`instructions`, or `--voice-description` in
the CLI) replaces the voice. The same description and seed give the same
audio for the same text; across different texts, the voice is similar rather
than identical. OpenAI's voice names map to the nearest preset (`alloy` and
`nova` to `ava`, `ash` and `echo` to `leo`, `ballad` and `fable` to `james`,
`coral` and `shimmer` to `zoe`, `onyx` and `cedar` to `omar`, `sage` to
`nora`, `verse` to `arjun`, `marin` to `priya`).

| Voice | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ava` (default) | Realistic female voice in the 30s age with a american accent. Normal pitch, warm timbre, conversational pacing, neutral tone delivery at med intensity, podcast domain, podcast_host role, neutral delivery. |
| `leo` | Realistic male voice in the 30s age with a american accent, otherwise as `ava`. |
| `nora` | Realistic female voice in the 30s age with a british accent. Normal pitch, smooth timbre, conversational pacing, corporate domain, explainer_video_voice role, formal delivery. |
| `james` | Realistic male voice in the 40s age with a british accent. Low pitch, deep timbre, slow pacing, entertainment domain, storyteller role. |
| `priya` | Realistic female voice in the 30s age with a indian accent. Normal pitch, smooth timbre, conversational pacing, support domain, customer_support_agent role. |
| `arjun` | Realistic male voice in the 20s age with a indian accent. Normal pitch, warm timbre, energetic tone, education domain, elearning_instructor role, casual delivery. |
| `zoe` | Realistic female voice in the 20s age with a american accent. High pitch, smooth timbre, brisk pacing, energetic tone, social_content domain, youtube_vlogger role. |
| `omar` | Realistic male voice in the 30s age with a middle_eastern accent. Low pitch, deep timbre, corporate domain, event_host role, formal delivery. |
| `robot` | Creative, ai_machine_voice character. Male voice in their 20s with a american accent. Normal pitch, robotic timbre, conversational pacing. |

Descriptions work best when they follow this template (age, gender, accent,
pitch, timbre, pacing, emotion and intensity, and for realistic voices a
domain and role) and end with a full stop: the model reads a short or
unfinished description aloud more often. Izwi adds the final full stop when
it is missing.
